/* 
BST with a property
1) every node to the left of given node is smaller than the node 
2) every node to the right of given node is greater than the node

Advantages:
1) Efficient Searching. Time Complexity O(log n).
2) Efficient insertion and deletion.
3) Usage in implementation of other data structure like sets, map, priority queues etc.

Disadvantage:
1) Lack of support for range queries.
2) Not that efficient in case of Binary Tree.
